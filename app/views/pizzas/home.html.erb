    <h1>Why We're Better</h1>
    <h2>You know you want us.</h2>
    <p>Our pizzas only have the good stuff. We like them round, thick, and saucy. Fresh till consumption ingredients and none of that fake ish you'll find in other pizzas. We're 100% all natural, baby.</p>

  <h3>Real Talk:</h3>
  <li class="list-group-item">We've been making pizza babies since 2010. That's longer than you've ever held a job.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">We sing to the dough every night to ensure it can dance in your mouth when it reaches maturity.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">We put the sauce on top because hot, juicy goodness is the first thing you should feel after a long day at work.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">We might be offensive, but even your grandmother wants a slice of this. Seriously. Ask her.</li>
